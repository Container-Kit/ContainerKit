# CLI Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the Container Kit CLI to remove unused development commands, simplify the codebase, and optimize for Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 26+.

## Changes Made

### 🗑️ Removed Components

#### 1. Development Commands

- **File Deleted**: `cmd/dev.go`
- **Commands Removed**:
    - `dev start` - Start development environment
    - `dev setup` - Setup development environment
    - `dev status` - Check development environment status
    - `dev clean` - Clean development artifacts
    - `dev reset` - Reset development environment

#### 2. Package Scripts

- **File Modified**: `package.json`
- **Scripts Removed**:
    - `cli:dev` - Build CLI and run dev commands
    - `dev:setup` - Setup development environment
    - `dev:clean` - Clean development artifacts
    - `dev:reset` - Reset development environment
    - `dev:status` - Check development environment status
    - `migration:interactive` - Interactive migration management (no longer supported)

#### 3. Documentation References

- **Files Modified**:
    - `SCRIPTS.md` - Removed dev workflow section
    - `cli/README.md` - Removed dev command documentation
    - `cmd/root.go` - Updated CLI description

### ✅ Retained Components

#### 1. Core Commands

- `build` - Build and sign Tauri applications
- `migration` - Database migration management
    - `migration generate` - Generate Rust files from SQL
    - `migration list` - List available migrations
    - `migration validate` - Validate migration files
    - `migration status` - Check migration system status

#### 2. Package Scripts

- `cli:build` - Build CLI and run build command
- `cli:help` - Show CLI help
- `migration:*` - All migration-related scripts

#### 3. Apple Silicon Optimization

- **Default Target**: Changed from `universal` to `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- **Target Priority**: Apple Silicon first, universal for compatibility
- **Requirements**: Updated to macOS 26+ with Apple Silicon focus

### 🎯 Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Codebase**

    - Removed ~350 lines of unused code
    - Eliminated dev command complexity
    - Cleaner command structure

2. **Focused Functionality**

    - CLI now focuses on core use cases: building and migrations
    - Removed overlapping functionality with existing tools
    - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Easier Maintenance**

    - Fewer commands to maintain and test
    - Reduced documentation burden
    - Simpler dependency management

4. **Better User Experience**
    - Cleaner help output
    - Faster CLI startup (no unused command initialization)
    - Clear, focused command set

## Current CLI Structure

```
container-kit-cli
├── build                    # Build and sign applications
│   ├── --target            # aarch64-apple-darwin (default), universal, x86_64-apple-darwin
│   ├── --mode              # release, debug
│   └── --verbose           # detailed output
└── migration               # Database migration management
    ├── generate            # Generate Rust files from SQL
    ├── list                # List all migrations
    ├── validate            # Validate migration files
    └── status              # Check system status
```

## Migration Path

### For Users Previously Using Dev Commands

Instead of CLI dev commands, use these alternatives:

| Old Command      | New Alternative                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `cli dev start`  | `pnpm dev` (existing npm script)        |
| `cli dev setup`  | `pnpm install` + manual setup           |
| `cli dev status` | `cli migration status` (for DB status)  |
| `cli dev clean`  | `rm -rf node_modules .svelte-kit build` |
| `cli dev reset`  | Manual cleanup + `pnpm install`         |

### Updated Workflows

**Before:**

```bash
pnpm cli:dev setup
pnpm cli:dev start
# Built for universal binary by default
```

**After:**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Builds for Apple Silicon by default (optimized for macOS 26+)
```

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files

- `package.json` - Removed 6 dev-related scripts
- `SCRIPTS.md` - Removed dev workflow section
- `cli/README.md` - Updated documentation
- `cmd/root.go` - Updated CLI description

### Deleted Files

- `cmd/dev.go` - Complete dev command implementation

### Lines of Code

- **Removed**: ~350 lines
- **Current CLI**: ~600 lines (focused and clean)

## Testing

All remaining functionality has been tested and verified:

✅ `container-kit-cli build` - Working
✅ `container-kit-cli migration *` - All subcommands working
✅ Package scripts - All remaining scripts functional
✅ Documentation - Updated and accurate

## Future Considerations

The CLI now has a focused scope on:

1. **Build Management** - Core Tauri application building (optimized for Apple Silicon)
2. **Migration Management** - Database schema management

**Apple Silicon Focus**: The CLI is now optimized for modern Macs running macOS 26+ with Apple Silicon processors, reflecting Container Kit's target platform requirements.

Any future additions should align with these core responsibilities and platform focus to maintain the clean, focused design achieved through this cleanup.
